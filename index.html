            <h2>Project summary</h4>
            <p>Many existing evaluation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) quickly become outdated
due to the emergence of new models and training data. These benchmarks also fall short in assessing
how LLM performance changes over time, as they consist of static questions without a temporal dimension. To address these limitations, we propose using future event prediction as a continuous evaluation
method to assess LLMs’ temporal generalization and forecasting abilities. Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, automatically generates question-answer (QA) pairs from daily news, challenging LLMs to predict
“future” event outcomes. Our findings reveal that as pre-training data becomes outdated, LLM performance degrades over time. While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance
prediction accuracy, the performance degradation pattern persists, highlighting the need for continuous
model updates.</p>
